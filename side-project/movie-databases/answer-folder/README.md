# ST207 Project Submission

All codes involved in building the database can be found in [Database Modelling and Creation Notebook](https://github.com/lse-st207/project-mt2021-database-team/blob/main/Answer%20Folder/Data%20Modelling%20and%20Creation.ipynb). Due to database storage size exceeds Github file size, we are unable to push the database to Github. Therefore, please run the entire codes in the database modeling and creation notebook to build the database in your environment.

**Data Cleaning 1** and **Data Cleaning 2** logs all the codes used to generate synthetic data for the use of the database.

**Project Documentation** is a PDF file documenting the process of building the database and all infromation needed to meet the project assignment's requirements.

**ER Model** is a PNG file that shows the database's ER model.

All data used for the database can be accessed here [/database_data/populate_date](https://github.com/lse-st207/project-mt2021-database-team/tree/main/database_data/populate_data)

**original data** file is for internal purposes. you can ignore this file entirely.
