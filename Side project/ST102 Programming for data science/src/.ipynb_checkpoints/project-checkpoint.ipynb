    "\n",
    "This project is a continuation of previous problem sets, namely problem set 8 and 9. In this project, I will make improvements on the existing class to reflect the real-world scenarios by relaxing a few oversimplified assumptions set in the previous problem sets. Therefore, I will generally do three tasks as per set by the ST101 project general guidelines. The first task is to create a new class `User` to represent subscribers of a streaming service. In this section, I will explore the combination implementation of the `User` and `Playlist` class. The second task involves further enhancing the coding functionality of the searching method by making the search engine works smarter and reflect more of the real world. I will implement an inverted index concept, that allows the search engine to find relevant shows related to any words given by the user and natural language processing (NLP), where I use a newly introduced package `NLTK` to do both stop words filtering and stemming. I will also consider a scenario in which the user gives more than one word to the search engine. And lastly, I will do a performance analysis on the search engine to dissect its weak parts so that improvements can be proposed. "

I decided to use the show's title instead of its ID number because it is easy to maintain and reuse for other functionality in the code. For example, I can use the show's title to call its corresponding `Show` instantly from `self._show` data container, rather than having to convert the ID number to the show's title and only then calling it `Show`. Moreover, I decided to implement the indexing at the same time an instance of `StreamingService` is made so that the indexing can be saved in _init_ function rather than having to do the indexing every time search() method is called which may cause inefficiency.

Assume that the number of searches is `k` and the number of words available across the three data used is `n`. For indexing, where we use dict as the container, each time `search()` module is called and, on average, it takes `O(1)` and, hence, in a total of all searches at the same time, it should be `O(k)`. However, if the brute force search is implemented, where it requires reiterating all `n` words to find the related shows, it may take on average `O(n)` and the total searches then should be `O(kn)` which is tremendously inefficient.

    "\n",
    "1. When the number of searches is big, the search engine takes a longer time to process and return relevant shows. \n",
    "2. When the exact title is used, the search engine does not work well as it returns around 8 to 10 irrelevant shows\n",
    "3. Two or three related terms based on the title are needed to return the exact title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than these three main conclusions, I also found that the search engine is doing badly when the show's title used is made up of English common words. This is the drawback when the `NLTK` library is used. A huge portion of the Netflix shows could not be searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two improvements\n",
    "1. To avoid having many irrelevant outputs, one improvement is to use rating and 'most search' shows data to sort the output show. Taking more information regarding the shows would help seach engine to make better predictions to return relevant shows with better accuracy\n",
    "2. When the number of searches is too big, parallel programming can be used to fasten the process of searching the relevant shows. "

    "In the project, I have done three tasks touching different part of the course\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In task 1, I created a new class to let users store their two different playlists which are the 'watch later' and 'favourite' playlist that operates slightly differently from each other. I make use of the inheritance concept to change the `play()` method for favourite playlist. I practise a good coding practice by doing testing, assertion and debugging to ensure the code works as intended. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In task 2, I made a significant improvement to the search engine to allow users to find shows without having to write the exact title of the shows. I make use of the inverted index and natural language processing concept to make this possible. I decided to apply the indexing when creating an instance of `StreamingService` so that the indexing can be used repeatedly every time the search() method is called and reduce the inefficiency. I use a `dictionary` container to build the index and apply a good control flow to assign data about titles, cast and descriptions to their corresponding index. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In task 3, I run a simulation on two different search engines that were created. The first one is the get_show() method and the second one is the search() method. The simulation is done to measure the efficiency and accuracy of the search engines when a big number of searches are to be made. The former is achieved by tracking the retrieval time for both search engines and comparing them to each other and the latter is measured by calculating the average number of unrelated shows that were shown as the outputs.This is where I use `Pandas` and `Numpy` library to showcase the performance analysis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "throughout the project, I ensure that I apply good error raising and handling to ensure all possible outcomes are considered. Abstractions are written for every function and class that was created. "
